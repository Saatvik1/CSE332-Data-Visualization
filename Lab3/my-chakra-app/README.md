In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may need to install the antd and d3 dependencies (if npm i doesnt work) by running 

### `npm install antd`

### `npm install d3`


some of the basic code for d3 plots and matplotlib plots in jupyter notebook was generated by GPT. Data reading, maninpulation, components, etc was done by me.
