Chat-GPT

Templates from the website and chat gpt were used to assist in making the plots in terms of styling and adding attributes, but the data manipulation and connection to the grpahs were done by me. Helper functions, unless stated otherwise in the code were also done by me. The boiler plate code in the backend was from the flask documentation, but the endpoints were created by me.

How to run:
Use Live Server extension on vsCode and run the page.html
cd into the backend folder and in terminal use "flask run" to run the backend file...
